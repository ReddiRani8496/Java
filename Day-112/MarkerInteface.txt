Marker Interface:
----------------

The marker interface in Java interfaces with no field or methods or, 

  in simple words empty interface in java is called a marker interface.

Example of marker interface is Serializable, Cloneable, and Remote interface.

Why Marker Interface?
--------------------

if JVM sees a Class is Serializable, it has done some special operation on it, a similar way, 

if JVM sees one Class is implement Cloneable, it performs some operation to support cloning.
