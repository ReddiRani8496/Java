ArrayDeque:
----------
    It follows FIFO(First In First Out).
    
    The ArrayDeque in Java provides a way to apply resizable-array in addition to the implementation of the Deque interface. 

    It is also known as Array Double Ended Queue or Array Deck. 

    This is a special kind of array that grows and allows users to add or remove an element from both sides of the queue.

Advantages:
----------

Efficient: The ArrayDeque class provides constant-time performance for inserting and removing elements 
                from both ends of the queue.

Resizable: The ArrayDeque class uses a resizable array to store its elements.

Lightweight: The ArrayDeque class is a lightweight data structure that does not require additional overhead.

Thread-safe: The ArrayDeque class is not thread-safe, but you can use the Collections.
                synchronizedDeque method to create a thread-safe version of the ArrayDeque class.

Disadvantages of using ArrayDeque:
----------------------------------
Not synchronized: By default, the ArrayDeque class is not synchronized, which means 
                    that multiple threads can access it simultaneously, leading to potential data corruption.

Limited capacity: it still has a limited capacity,  which means that you may need to create a new ArrayDeque 
                    when the old one reaches its maximum size.

Intefaces implemented by ArrayDeque:
