Vector class: 
------------
        Vector implements a dynamic array which means it can grow or shrink as required. 

        Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer index.

        They are very similar to ArrayList, but Vector is synchronized and has some legacy methods that the collection framework does not contain.

Operations on Vector class:
-------------------------

    Adding elements -> the add() method is used to add elements into the Vector.

    Updating elements -> the set() method is used to update the elements in the Vector.

    Removing elements -> the remove() method is used to remove elements in the Vector.

    Iterating over elements -> using the basic for loop in combination with a get() method to get the element at a specific index.

Advantages of Vector:
-------------------
-> Synchronization
-> Dynamic size
-> Legacy support

Disadvantages of Vector:
------------------------
-> slower performance

Difference between ArrayList and Vector:
---------------------------------------

                    ArrayList                                                               Vector

1.   	ArrayList is not synchronized.	                                    Vector is synchronized.

2.	ArrayList increments 50% of the current array size                      Vector increments 100% means doubles the array size
        if the number of elements exceeds ts capacity.	                      if the total number of elements exceeds its capacity.

3.	ArrayList is not a legacy class. It is introduced in JDK 1.2.	        Vector is a legacy class.

4.	ArrayList is fast because it is non-synchronized.	                    Vector is slow because it is synchronized

5.	ArrayList uses the Iterator interface to traverse the elements.	        A Vector can use the Iterator interface or enumeration to traverse the elements.

6	ArrayList performance is high 	                                        Vector performance is low 

7	Multiple threads is allowed 	                                        Only one threads are allowed .
