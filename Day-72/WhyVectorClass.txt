Vector really has some problems... why is it still in Java and why should it be taught?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The fact is that Java professes the principle of backward compatibility.

 This means that all old code written many years ago will be understood by modern versions of Java. 

 In addition, there are quite a few enterprise-level applications in the Java environment that have been supported for decades. 

 It is quite possible that you will have to deal with Vector class in your work,
    so you need to be prepared for surprises, such as code with ineffective legacy classes.
