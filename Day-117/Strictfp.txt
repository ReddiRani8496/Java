strictfp keyword:
----------------

-> stands for strict floating point, introduced in java 1.2

-> Used in java for restricting floating point calculations and ensuring the same result on every platform.

-> strictfp modifier is used with classes,interface, and methods only but is not applicable to apply with variables.

-> When a class or interface is declared with strictfp modifier, then all methods declaredin the class/interface are implicitly strictfp

-> strictfp cannot be used with abstract methods. It can be used with abstract classes.

-> Since methods of an interface are implicitly abstract, strictfp cannot be with any method inside an interface.

-> Java 17 version, strictfp keyword is not required explicitly as all floating point expressions are strictly evaluated.
