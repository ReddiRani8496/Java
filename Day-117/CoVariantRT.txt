Covariant Return Type :
--------------------

-> The covariant return type specifies that the return type may vary in the same direction as the subclass.

-> Before Java5, it was not possible to override any method by changing the return type.

->  But now, since Java5, it is possible to override method by changing the return type
    if subclass overrides any method whose return type is Non-Primitive but it changes its return type to subclass type.

Advantages:
---------
->  Covariant return type assists to stay away from the confusing type casts in the class hierarchy and 
        makes the code more usable, readable, and maintainable.

->  In the method overriding, the covariant return type provides the liberty to have more to the point return types.

->  Covariant return type helps in preventing the run-time ClassCastExceptions on returns.
