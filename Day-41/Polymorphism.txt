Polymorphism:
------------    Polymorphism is two words i.e., poly and morphism, poly means "many" and morphism means "forms".Hence Polymorphism means one thing 
exist in many forms.
Types of Polymorphism:
----------------------
                        1.Compile_time Polymorphism
                        2.Runtime Polymorphism
1)Compile_time Polymorphism is achieved by Method overloading or function overloading.
Method overloading:
------------------
                    Methods should have same name but can differ in arguments.
2)Runtime Polymorphism is achieved by Method overriding.
Method overriding : 
-------------------     When a subclass has same method as parent class is called Method overriding.
