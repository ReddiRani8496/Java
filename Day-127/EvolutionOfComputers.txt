Evolution Of Computers:
----------------------

Barter System:
--------------

Barter is a system of exchange in which participants directly exchange goods or services 
    for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money.

Disadvantage of barter system:
------------------------------

Any commodity can't be exchanged at any point of time.
If two persons are far distance, then barter system will not work.



Money:
-----

To overcome Disadvantage of barter system Money is introduced.

Advantages:
----------

Any commodity can be exchanged at any point of time using money.



At olden calculations are like:
------------------------------

If there is one general store, the items and money collected is calculated as:

for example, 5 items are calculated as:

| | | | |

if first is done then first one is crossed out, until last.

To overcome this problem number system came into existence:
----------------------------------------------------------

Types of Number System:
----------------------

There are four types of number systems:

1. Binary number system
2. Octal number system
3. Decimal number system
4. HexaDecimal number system

By using decimal number system we can calculate the data, but 
 -> It takes more time
 -> Less accuracy
 -> More human resource is required

To overcome this problem Calculator is introduced:
-------------------------------------------------

Calculator is used to perform Arithmetic operations like:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Divison

But here we can't store the data.

To overcome this problem Computers are introduced:
--------------------------------------------------

It performs both Arithmetic and Logical operations.

Arithmetic operations like: 
--------------------------
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Divison

Logical operations like:
-----------------------

> (greater than)
< (less than)
>= (greater than or equal to)
<= (less than or equal to)
== (equal to)
&& (logical and)
|| (logical or)

Computers store the data.

Generations of Computers:
------------------------

There are five generations of computers. These are:

1. First Generation

2. Second Generation 

3. Third Generation   

4. Fourth Generation  

5. Fifth Generation  


Computers of First Generation (1940 to 1956)
--------------------------------------------

The first-generation computer was a fragile device. 

It was made of glass and the central technology was a vacuum tube.

The computers of this generation were heavy, bulky and  used a lot of electricity.

Computers of the first generation conducted operations using machine language, a low-level programming language.

Computers of Second Generation (1956 to 1963)
---------------------------------------------

Second-generation computers were developed using transistor technology instead of vacuum tubes. 

The size of the computers was smaller, and the calculation time was also shorter compared with computers of the first generation.

The CPU is made up of Transistors, which is a semiconductor.

If voltage high - 1, otherwise 0.

Computers of Third Generation (1964 to 1971)
-------------------------------------------

It consist of Assembly language. 

It contains Assembler as translator.

Assembler is used to convert the Assembly language into machine code.

Assembly language consist of mnemonics, like 
add -> Addition
sub -> Subtraction
mul -> Multiplication etc.

Computers of Fourth Generation (1971 â€“ Present) 
-----------------------------------------------

It consist of high level languages.

Examples: Java, c, c++, python, kotlin, ruby etc.

It is easier to understand.

The code is like normal english.

Easy to write the code.

100 times simple and easy when compared to binary language or assembly language.

It contains two translators:
---------------------------

Complier:
--------

Used to compile the entire source code.

Java is a compiled programming language.

It takes more memory.

The main advantage of compiler is, it converts source code to byte code only one time, we can run as many times we need.

Disadvantage of compiler is, if starting statements are correct and only last line of code contains error, it doesn't execute remaining lines.

Example:
-------
int age = 20;
System.out.println(age);
System.out.println("hello");
System.out.println(marks); // it contains error, so it shows compile time error, previous statements will not execute.

Interpreter:
-----------

Interpreter program works line-by-line.

Interpreter takes less memory.

Python is a interpreted programming language.

The advantage of Interpreter is, it runs the program from first line and stops execution only if it encounters an error.

The Disadvantage of Interpreter is, the source code need to be translated to machine code every time we run the program.

Example:
-------
int age = 20;
System.out.println(age);
System.out.println("hello");
System.out.println(marks);

Output:
------
20
hello
Then error will occur.
