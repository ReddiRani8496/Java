Differences between C++ and java :
--------------------------------

                C++                                                  Java

-> C++ is platform dependent.                             -> Java is platform independent.

-> C++ mainly used for system programming.                -> Java is  mainly used for application programming.

-> C++ supports multiple inheritance.                     -> Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through class,
                                                                but it can be achieved by interface.
                                                        
-> C++ supports operator overloading.                     -> Java doesn't support operator overloading.

-> C++ supports pointers.                                 -> Java has restricted pointer support in java.

-> C++ uses compiler only.                                -> Java uses both compiler and interpreter.

-> C++ supports both call by value                        -> Java supports call by value only.
    and call by reference                                       There is no call by reference in java.

-> C++ supports structures and unions.                    -> Java doesn't support structures and unions.

-> C++ doesn't have built-in support for                  -> Java has built-in thread support.
    threads.

-> C++ doesn't support documentation                      -> Java supports documentation comments(/**...*/).
    comments.

-> C++ supports virtual keyboard.                         -> Java doesn't supports virtual keyboard.

-> C++ is nearer to hardware.                             -> Java is not so interactive with hardware.
