Time Complexity:
----------------
                    The amount of time taken to execute the program or a statement.

O(1): Every time a constant amount of time is required to execute code.

O(logn):

A method with a logarithmic complexity (where n is really big) divides the issue into little bits for each iteration (log n).
 It takes log(N) steps to execute a particular operation on N items, where the logarithm base is usually 2.
 Because the logarithm base is not critical to the order of the operation count, it is frequently ignored.
