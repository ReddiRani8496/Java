Stream API:
----------

    Sequence of data that supports multiple operations like filtering, mapping etc.

    Don't change the original structure.

    Don't hold data, stream process data.

Why Streams are lazy?
--------------------

    Because all intermediate operations are not executed until terminal operation starts.

    Terminal operations call the intermediate operations.
