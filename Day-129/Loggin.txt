Logging in Java:

Logging is a crucial aspect of software development, allowing developers to record important information about the application's behavior at runtime.

Java provides a built-in logging framework through the java.util.logging package, which allows developers to log messages at various levels of severity.

Key components of Java Logging:

    Logger: The central class responsible for logging messages.

     Developers obtain an instance of the Logger class to log messages from different parts of the application.

    Handlers: Handlers determine where log messages are sent. 

    Java provides various built-in handlers like ConsoleHandler and FileHandler. 

    Custom handlers can also be implemented to direct log messages to specific destinations.

    Formatters: Formatters control the format of log messages. They determine how the log messages are presented in the output. Java has a SimpleFormatter, but custom formatters can be created as well.

    Log Levels: Log levels categorize log messages based on their severity. Java defines seven standard log levels, listed from the most severe to the least:
        SEVERE: Messages about critical errors that may cause the application to crash.
        WARNING: Messages about potential issues or unexpected behavior.
        INFO: General information about the application's state and progress.
        CONFIG: Configuration information.
        FINE: Detailed information for debugging purposes.
        FINER: Even more detailed information than FINE.
        FINEST: The most detailed information for debugging.

Usage of Log Levels:

Developers can use these log levels to control the verbosity of log output. 

During development and debugging, lower log levels (e.g., FINE, FINER, FINEST) can be used to obtain more detailed information about the application's behavior.

In production, higher log levels (e.g., SEVERE, WARNING, INFO) are typically used to keep the log output concise and only log important messages.
