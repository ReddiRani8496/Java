Garbage Collection:
------------------
    Garbage collection is the process of freezing memory allocated to objects that are no longer used.
    
    During runtime, when an object is created, the JVM allocates some memory to hold the object.
    
    The JVM periodically checks for objects that are in use and deallocates the memory for those objects which are not in use.

    So, the programmer does not have to bother about manual de-allocation of memory.
    
    Garbage collection is done in the heap memory.
