LinkedList:
----------  

The elements in a Java LinkedList are actually links in a single chain. 

In addition to data, each element stores references to the previous and next elements. 

These references let you move from one element to another. 

 Performing Various Operations on LinkedList:
 ------------------------------------------

   -> Adding elements
   -> Updating elements
   -> Removing elements
   -> Iterating over elements

Advantages:
---------
-> Dynamic size
-> Efficient insertions and deletions
-> Flexible iteration

Disadvantages:
-------------
-> LinkedList has slower performance than ArrayList when accessing individual elements.
-> LinkedList require more memory than ArrayList.
