String literal:
--------------
                The value of String is called String literal.
                Ex: String str = "Java";

                Here java is string literal, stored in String pool.
                String literal takes less time to execute.
                If there already exists a String value "Java", then str will reference of that String and no new String object will be created. 

String object:
-------------
                String str = new String("Hello");
                
                The String created with new keyword is called String object. 
                String object takes more time to execute, it will construct a new String everytime it is executed.
                It is created outside the String pool.
