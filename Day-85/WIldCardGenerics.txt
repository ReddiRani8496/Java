wildcards in java:
------------------

    The question mark (?) is known as the wildcard in generic programming. It represents an unknown type. 

    The wildcard can be used in a variety of situations such as the type of a parameter, field, or local variable; 
        sometimes as a return type. 

Types of wildCards:
------------------

1. Upper Bounded Wildcards:
   -----------------------

    These wildcards can be used when you want to relax the restrictions on a variable. 

    To declare an upper-bounded wildcard, use the wildcard character (‘?’), 
        followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound. 
                        -------
Syntax:
------
    public static void add(List<? extends Number> list)

2. Lower Bounded Wildcards: 
--------------------------

        It is expressed using the wildcard character (‘?’), followed by the super keyword, 
                                                                            ------
            followed by its lower bound: <? super A>. 

 Syntax: 
 ------
    Collectiontype <? super A>

3. Unbounded Wildcard: 

    This wildcard type is specified using the wildcard character (?), for example, List.
    This is called a list of unknown types.
    
    These are useful in the following cases –

    -> When writing a method that can be employed using functionality provided in Object class.
    -> When the code is using methods in the generic class that doesn’t depend on the type parameter
