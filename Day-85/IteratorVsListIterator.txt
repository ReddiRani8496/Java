It can traverse elements present in a Collection                It can traverse elements present in a Collection 
    only in the forward direction. 	                                both in forward and backward directions.


It is used to traverse Map, List, and Set.          	        It is used only to traverse List.
                                                                    That is it canâ€™t traverse Map and Set.

Iterator cannot add elements to a Collection. 	                ListIterator can add elements to the Collection.

An Iterator cannot modify the elements in the Collection. 	    A ListIterator can modify the elements in 
                                                                    
An Iterator has no method to obtain an index of                 ListIterator can be used to obtain the index of
    the element in a given Collection.                               an element in the Collection.

It has methods like hasNext(), next(), remove(). 	            It has methods like add(E e), hasNext(), hasPrevious(),
                                                                 next(), nextIndex(), previous(), previousIndex(),
