Array: 
-----
        Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses 

        for the elements stored and this allows faster access to an element at a specific index.

LinkedList:
----------  

The elements in a Java LinkedList are actually links in a single chain. 

In addition to data, each element stores references to the previous and next elements. 

These references let you move from one element to another. 


            Array                                                LinkedList

-> Arrays are stored in contiguous locations.               -> LinkedLists are not stored in contiguous locations.

-> Fixed in size.                                           -> Dynamic in size

-> Memory is allocated at compile time.                     -> Memory is allocated at run time.

-> Uses less memory than LinkedList.                        -> Uses more memory because it stores data and 
                                                                    address of next node.

-> elements can be accessed easily.                         -> Element accessing requires the traversal of whole
                                                                    LinkedList.

-> Insertion and deletion Operations                        -> Insertion and deletion Operations are faster.
    takes time.

Advantages of LinkedList:
------------------------

-> Dynamic in size
-> Insertion and deletion Operations are faster.

Disadvantages of LinkedList:
---------------------------

-> Uses more memory because it stores data and address of next node.
-> Element accessing requires the traversal of whole  LinkedList.

Advantages of Array :
-------------------
-> Elements can be accessed easily.
-> Uses less memory than LinkedList.

Disadvantages of Array :
----------------------
-> Fixed in size.
-> Insertion and deletion Operations takes time.
