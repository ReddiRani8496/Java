In Java, documentation comments (Javadoc comments) are used to generate API documentation for classes, methods, 
 
 and other program elements. The purpose of Javadoc comments is to provide information and 
    
 documentation about the code to make it easier for developers to understand and use.

The main method in Java is the entry point of a Java program. It is a special method that gets executed when the program starts. 

However, the main method is not considered an API element that would typically be part of a public interface or library documentation. 

The main method is specific to the program's execution and is not intended to be used or referenced by external code or developers.

Javadoc comments are primarily meant to provide documentation for reusable elements,

such as classes, methods, fields, and interfaces, which can be used by other developers to interact with the code. 

As the main method is not part of the public API, there is no need to write Javadoc comments specifically for it.

That being said, you can still add regular comments (non-Javadoc comments) inside the main method 

to provide explanations or  additional details about the logic or functionality of the program. 


These comments won't be processed by the Javadoc tool for documentation generation 

but can serve as helpful notes for yourself or other developers working on the codebase.
