Why record keyword?

Commonly, we write classes to simply hold data, such as database results, query results, 

or information from a service.

In many cases, this data is immutable, since immutability ensures the validity of the data without synchronization.

To accomplish this, we create data classes with the following:
--------------------------------------------------------------

-> private, final field for each piece of data

-> getter for each field

-> public constructor with a corresponding argument for each field

-> equals method that returns true for objects of the same class when all fields match

-> hashCode method that returns the same value when all fields match

-> toString method that includes the name of the class and the name of each field and its corresponding value
