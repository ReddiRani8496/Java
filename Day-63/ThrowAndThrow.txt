throw keyword:
--------------
                The throw keyword in java is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or a block of code.

                We can throw either checked or unchecked exception.

                Syntax:
                -------         throw Instance
                Example:
                --------          throw new ArithmeticException("/by zero");
    
throws keyword:
--------------  
                throws is a keyword in java which is used in the signature of method to indicate that this method might throw one of

                the listed type exception.

                Syntax:
                ------      returntype method_name(parameters) throws exception_list

                To prevent this compile time error we can handle the exception in two ways:
                            1) using try catch
                            2) using throws keyword
