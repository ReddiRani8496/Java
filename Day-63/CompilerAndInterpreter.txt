Compiler :
--------     A compiler in java translates the entire source code into a machine code file or any intermediate code,

and that file is then executed.

                                             Compiler (using javac cmd)
                                Source Code -----------------------------> Byte code 

-> Compiler scans the complete source code in one go and then highlights the error.

Interpreter:
-----------
            An Interpreter is a computer program that converts the high-level program statement into Assembly-level language.

                                    Interpreter (using java cmd)
                        ByteCode  -------------------------------->Machine Code
                
-> Interpreter converts the byte code into the native code of the machine.
-> This process is done line by line.
-> If the error comes on any line, the process is stopped over there.
