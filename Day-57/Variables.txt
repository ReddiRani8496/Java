Types of variables:
------------------
                    1) Local variable
                    2) Instance variable
                    3) static variable
1) Local variable:
   --------------
                A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called Local variable.
                The scope of Local variable is within the block or method or constructor.

2) Instance variable:
   -----------------
                A variable declared inside a class and outside of any method or block or constructor is called Instance variable.
                These variables are created when an object of the class is created.
                Each object will have its own copy of memory.

3)Static variables:
  -----------------
                The variables declared using the static keyword within a class and outside of method are called static variables.
                We can only have one copy of static variable per class, irrespective of how many objects create.
                Static variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.
