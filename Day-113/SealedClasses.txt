Sealed Classes:
--------------

A sealed class is a technique that limits the number of classes that can inherit the given class.

This means that only classes designated by the programmer can inherit from that particular class, 

    thereby restricting the access to it.

When a class is declared sealed, the programmer must specify the list of classes that can inherit it.

This concept was introduced in Java 15.
