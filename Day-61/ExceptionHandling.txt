Exception Handling:
------------------
                    Exception Handling used to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved.

Major reasons why an exception occurs:
-------------------------------------
-> Invalid user input
-> Device faliure
-> Loss of network connection
-> Physical limitations
-> code errors
-> Opening an unavailable file 

Difference between Error and Exception:
---------------------------------------

Error: An error indicates a serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch.

Exception: Exception indicates conditions that a reasonable application might try to catch.
