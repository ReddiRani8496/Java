StackOverflowError:
-----------------
                        StackOverflowError is an error which java doesn't allow to catch, for instance, stack running out of space,
                        
                        as it's one of  the most common runtime errors one can encounter.

                        The main cause of the StackOverflowError is that we HAVEN'T PROVIDED THE PROPER TERMINATING CONDITION to our
                        
                        recursive function or templete, which means it will turn into an infinite loop.
