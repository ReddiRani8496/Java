Phase 1: Mark Phase 
-----------------
When an object is created, its mark bit is set to 0(false). 
In the Mark phase, we set the marked bit for all the reachable objects  to 1(true).

Phase 2: Sweep Phase 
-------------------
As the name suggests it “sweeps” the unreachable objects,
it clears the heap memory for all the unreachable objects. 
All those objects whose marked value is set to false are cleared from the heap memory, 
for all other objects (reachable objects) the marked bit is set to true.
