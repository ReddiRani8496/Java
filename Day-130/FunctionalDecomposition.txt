Functional Decomposition:
-------------------------

Functional decomposition is a software design technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, 

manageable functions or methods in Java. Each function performs a specific task, and when combined, these functions work together to solve the larger problem. 

This approach is essential for creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

Functional decomposition is not key to everything, but using this approach will help you create neat and understandable programs that are easy to work with.

Advantages of Functional decomposition:
--------------------------------------

    Dividing Complex Problems: Functional decomposition allows developers to divide a large and intricate problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Each sub-problem can then be tackled individually, making the overall development process easier.

    Modularity: By breaking down the problem into smaller functions, each function can be written and tested independently. This modularity enables code reusability, as these functions can be used in various parts of the application or in other projects.

    Abstraction and Encapsulation: Functional decomposition encourages the use of abstraction and encapsulation. Functions can hide their implementation details, allowing the rest of the program to use them without worrying about their internal workings.

    Readability and Maintainability: Smaller functions with specific tasks are often easier to read and understand. This makes the codebase more maintainable and reduces the complexity of debugging and troubleshooting.

    Debugging and Testing: With functional decomposition, it's easier to pinpoint errors or bugs because each function is designed to handle a particular task. Isolating the problem to a specific function makes debugging and testing more efficient.

    Team Collaboration: When using functional decomposition, teams can assign different functions to different developers, facilitating parallel development and collaboration.

    Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions: In Java, functional decomposition can be further enhanced by using functional interfaces and lambda expressions. These features allow you to treat functions as first-class citizens,
                        
                         making it easier to pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and use them in functional programming paradigms.
