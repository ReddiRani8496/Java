java.util.function is a new package added in java8.

lot of built-in functional interfaces, many methods of streams will take functional interfaces in the input.

Consumer interface:
------------------

The person who consumes something and returns nothing is called a consumer.

built-in functional interface

part of java 8

it has method called accept(T t)

that accepts an argument of any data type

operate on that data T

it returns nothing/no result

lambda expression

Function interface:
------------------

Function can be used to transform an input value

it accepts an argument of any data type

transforms it and returns a result

Supplier interface :
-------------------

Supplier can be used to produce a value

it doesn't accept any argument

but produces a result of any data type

Difference between Supplier and Consumer interfaces:
----------------------------------------------------

Consumer will take any data type and returns nothing / void

Supplier doesn't take any data and returns something/not void

Predicate interface:
-------------------

The predicate is a predefined functional interface in Java defined in the java.util.Function package.

It evaluates the predicate on the value passed to this function as the argument and then returns a boolean value.

Predicate will take any data type.
